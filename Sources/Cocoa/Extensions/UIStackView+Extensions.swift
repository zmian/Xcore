extension UIStackView {
    /// Moves the provided view to the array of arranged subviews at the specified index.
    ///
    /// If index is already occupied, the stack view increases the size of the `arrangedSubviews`
    /// array and shifts all of its contents at the index and above to the next higher space in the
    /// array. Then the stack view stores the provided view at the `index`.
    ///
    /// The stack view also ensures that the `arrangedSubviews` array is always a subset of its
    /// subviews array. This method automatically adds the provided view as a subview of the stack
    /// view, if it is not already. When adding subviews, the stack view appends the view to the end
    /// of its subviews array. The index only affects the order of views in the `arrangedSubviews`
    /// array. It does not affect the ordering of views in the subviews array.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - view: The view to be moved from the array of views arranged by the stack.
    ///   - stackIndex: The index where the stack moves the new view in its `arrangedSubviews` array.
    ///                 This value must not be greater than the number of views currently in this array.
    ///                 If the index is out of bounds, this method throws an `internalInconsistencyException`
    ///                 exception.
